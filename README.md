# micro:bit V2 stubs for VS Code

## About this package
When I started working with the BBC micro:bit V2, I realised that the extensions for VS Code I wanted to use, didn't have up-to-date stubs for autocompletion. The extensions I tried all use the microbitstubs by [Joseph Fergusson](https://github.com/PhonicCanine/microbit). As these were written for micro:bit V1, they don't imply new functions of the V2.
This package aims on being an up-to-date stubs library. If you encounter any issues or I fail on implementing updates, please let me know. Basically this package is a properly set out version of [oivron's microbit stubs](https://github.com/oivron/microbit-stubs), for easier use.

## Usage
Just copy the microbit package into your working directory.
