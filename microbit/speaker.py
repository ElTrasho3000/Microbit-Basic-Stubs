#Speaker V2

""" The micro:bit V2 has a built-in speaker located on the rear of the board.
By default sound output will be via the edge connector on pin 0 and the built-in speaker V2. 
You can connect wired headphones or a speaker to pin 0 and GND on the edge connector to hear 
the sounds.
The speaker can be turned off or on using the functions listed here. """
